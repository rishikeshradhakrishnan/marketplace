# Analyze Repository Command

When invoked, perform a comprehensive analysis of the current repository:

1. **Structure Analysis**: Identify the project type, languages, and frameworks
2. **Documentation Check**: Find existing docs and identify gaps
3. **Code Quality Scan**: Use the code-reviewer skill on key files
4. **Dependency Review**: List major dependencies and their purposes

Output a structured report with sections for each analysis area.
Highlight any immediate concerns or recommendations.
